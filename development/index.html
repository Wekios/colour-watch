              If you've never had a HealthWatch before, this is THE watch for
              you!
            </p>
            <p>
              A few weeks ago, we celebrated the launch of a new HealthWatch on
              the market, and it is cheaper and easier to use than the previous
              ones.
            </p>
            <p>
              This is not an ordinary HealthWatch , it is equipped with the
              latest technologies. It allows to obtain the same results as a
              watch of £ 350.

            <h3>Why this HealthWatch saves lives?</h3>
            <img src="./images/xHealthWatcha.jpg" alt="health watch" />
            <p>
              It is now well known that heart disease and other health problems
              are increasing because of our modern lifestyle. The main reason
              for these diseases is the lack of regular physical exercise by
              many people. According to the WHO (World Health Organization), a
              person already suffers from a lack of physical activity if they
              travel less than 90 minutes a day. And what about You? Are you one
              of those people who do not move enough?
            </p>
            <p>
              In addition to the effects of a sedentary lifestyle, heart disease
              and other medical problems are also favored by unhealthy diets,
              work-related stress and the worries of daily life. More and more
              people are neglecting their health and choosing not to do physical
              activity; only a healthy lifestyle ensures emotional balance and
              daily well-being!
            </p>
            <p>
              For those of us who do not move enough and who do not perform
              useful routine medical exams, this health-centric connected watch
              is invaluable. It is a smartwatch that measures all the vital
              data: a real medical assistant on your wrist.
            </p>
            <p>
              That's why this smartwatch is also one of the best-selling
              smartwatches in the world. Everyone wants to do something for
              their health, which is why it sells like hotcakes.

              The HealthWatch was developed by a team of experts who wanted to
              create a high-quality watch with health data sensors that could be
              bought by anyone, but was also extremely durable and had enough
              battery. They also wanted to make its handling so easy that even
              people with little technical knowledge could use it.
            </p>
            <p>
              For that, they had to imagine this HealthWatch from scratch; and
              the result of all this research and development is quite amazing.

              parameter for assessing respiratory function. In many cases, it
              allows conclusions to be drawn about the functioning and activity
              of the lungs
